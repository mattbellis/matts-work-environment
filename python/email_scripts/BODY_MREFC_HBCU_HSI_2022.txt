We are very excited to announce that applications are open for the CMS MREFC
2022 Summer Internship Program for Underrepresented Minority Undergraduate 
Students!  We would like to ask you to encourage representative undergraduate 
students at your institution who are pursuing their degrees in STEM fields such
as Physics, Astronomy, Engineering, or related fields to apply. The deadline to
apply is Jan. 31, 2022.

The Compact Muon Solenoid Upgrade (CMS) Major Research Equipment and Facility
Construction (MREFC) Project is a unique and exciting project to upgrade the
CMS detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. The LHC is the
largest and most powerful particle accelerator in the world. Upgrades will
enable the CMS detector to work at higher intensity and extend our reach in
the search for New Physics.

We are reaching out to you as a faculty member at a school who educates a
higher proportion of non-White students than many other institutions. Every 
community benefits from a diversity of lived experiences and high-energy 
physics is no different. Our collaboration created this internship specifically
to solicit students who might not otherwise have considered working on this 
type of science.

These are paid positions and the funds come from an umbrella grant from the NSF, 
specifically for upgrades to the CMS experiment. Hosting institutions have been
selected specifically because of their commitment to providing a supportive and
equitable environment. We plan on providing onboarding materials in advance of 
the summer work for any students or local mentors who might be interested. 

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me (Matt Bellis, 
mbellis@siena.edu) or Brenda Smith (bkc4@cornell.edu).

Thank you for considering sharing this with your students. And have a great
winter break!

Internships:

Project leaders seek to hire several undergraduate students to work on various
development teams during summer 2022. Internship positions are full-time (39
hrs/wk) and involve hands-on development of hardware components
performed in an on-campus laboratory. 

The summer 2022 projects include:

* Boston University (Boston, MA) - readout electronics for the pixel detector
and track trigger,
* Purdue University (West Lafayette, IN) - pixel detector mechanics and
module construction
* University of Kansas (Lawrence, KA) - readout electronics for pixel
detector.

Applicants may express interest in internships at more than one
institution. Length of internships are 8 to 10 weeks depending on the
institution. The program will pay the standard undergraduate summer intern
rate at each institution, housing will be provided, and relocation costs
will be covered or reimbursed.

Training and mentorship will be provided. Interns will be matched with a
faculty mentor and will be part of a peer cohort of summer students (from
various programs in physics). Interns will also participate in the
larger CMS undergraduate student cohort remote activities.

Eligibility:

* No prior experience in this area of specialty is required. Training and
mentorship will be provided.
* Qualifications include a C or higher (2.0 / 4.0 GPA) in introductory
mechanics and electricity and magnetism, an interest in high-energy
physics, and a willingness to learn new skills.
* Many institutions require all employees to be fully vaccinated against
COVID-19, or to have obtained a university-approved medical or religious
exemption. For additional information on this requirement, visit:
https://hr.cornell.edu/covid/university-response/vaccination
* If accepted, you will have to show proof of health insurance coverage 
for the period of the Internship Program. 
* The Internship program is open only to US citizens and permanent
residents. If accepted, you will be required to show proof of citizenship
or permanent residency.
* This program is intended primarily for sophomore and junior students in
science and engineering. In exceptional cases first year students could
have enough familiarity with physics, engineering, or computer science to
profit from their research experience.
* Students who have not yet enrolled as undergraduates are not eligible. In
some cases seniors may be considered, depending on employment rules at the
hosting institutions (in some cases graduating seniors cannot be appointed
in undergraduate internship positions).
