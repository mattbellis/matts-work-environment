\question[5] A wooden box that weighs 60. kg is sitting on a carpeted floor such that the
coefficient of kinetic friction is $\mu_k = 0.25$. You pull on with with a rope angled
slightly upward, such that the rope makes an angle of 30.$^\circ$ with the horizontal.\\

If you are pulling with a force (magnitude) of 600. N, what is the frictional force
when the box is moving?

\begin{choices}
    \choice 34.9
    \choice 42.3
    \choice 58.7
    \choice 64.8
    \CorrectChoice 72.3
\end{choices}

\begin{solution}[8cm]
    \begin{eqnarray*}
        \sum F_y &=& ma_y\\
        F_g + F_{T_y} + F_N &=& ma_y\\
        (60)(-9.81) + (600)\sin(30) + F_N &=& 0 \\
        F_N &=& 289 N \\
        F_f &=& \mu_k F_N \\
            &=& (0.25) (289) \\
            &=& 72.25 N
    \end{eqnarray*}
\end{solution}
