A search for a $B$ meson decaying to a baryon
and a lepton is performed, where the baryon is
either a $\Lambda_c$ or $\Lambda$ and the lepton is
a muon or electron. This decay violates both baryon and lepton number
and is a signature of physics beyond the standard model.
No significant signal is observed in any of the decay modes
and upper limits in the range $(3.2-520) \times 10^{-8}$
are set on the branching fractions at the 90\% confidence level.
